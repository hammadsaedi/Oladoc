like Book appointments, Cancellation, check availability, etc. are only accessible to the
registered users.

## Book Appointment
There are many ways a patient can find a doctor to book an appointment
- Patient can find a doctor via his/her specialty (categories) like dermatologist, neurologist, etc
- Patient can also find doctors via hospital name or city
- Your system cannot book 2 appointments for the same doctor at the same time.

available for the doctor.
- Charges for in-person and video consultation appointments are different for each Doctor.
- Patient can check all his booked appointments and their status in his profile
- Maintain a separate file to store the appointment information which will include Doctor CNIC,
Doctor name, Patient CNIC, patient name, appointment mode, day, and time.

you reflect in the system that the appointment is canceled and it is no more scheduled)

## Feedback

the doctor
- Feedback rating must be maintained based on patients’ reviews about the doctor
- The feedback must be shown on the concerned doctor’s profile
- The overall ratings that would be displayed on the doctor’s profile must be the average of all the
ratings which will never exceed length 5
- Bonus: A reply on the review of patients from the management can also be implemented

## Payment
The payment details for each booked appointment are recorded. Appointment charges for all the
appointments are displayed to the users.
- Charges for in-person and video consultation appointments are different for each Doctor.
- The system must calculate the charges by keeping in mind that video consultation is 70% of the
in-person appointment charges (30% less).
- As the payment is a transaction from the doctor’s account to the patient’s account, the return
would be the inverse of the transaction
- The patient should be able to select an E-Gateway for the transaction such as JazzCash,
EasyPaisa, PayPak, UnionPay or Bank Transfer
- Set a criterion for if the patient does not show up on the date of appointment, a percentage
would be deducted from the amount he paid + he would have to pay that percentage again
- -30% after one day
E.g., 100 already paid for an appointment, 30 would he pay if come a day later
- -60% after two days (Patient would have to pay 60% extra)
E.g., 100 already paid for an appointment, 60 would he pay if come a day later
- -100% on three days (Patient would have to fix the appointment again)
E.g., 100 already paid for an appointment, the patient would re-fix an
appointment and would have to pay 100 again if he comes after three days
- In case the patient wants to cancel the appointment
- 100% return on the same day of fixing the appointment
- 60% return on the second day of fixing the appointment
- 30% return on the third day of fixing the appointment
- No return after the third day

link to the main menu (different menu for the different users e.g. Admin, patient, doctor)
